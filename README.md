# Dark-Themed Spigot Docs
This webpage by Cannicide provides various versions of SpigotMC documentation, starting at 1.20.1-R0.1, with custom dark theme styling.

## Currently Available Versions
- [1.20.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT](https://spigot.cannicide.net/1.20.1)

## Disclaimer
The styling of these docs have been tweaked by Cannicide, but the content of the docs remains the same.

This documentation is being provided online through [spigot.cannicide.net](https://spigot.cannicide.net) as a convenience. Only the docs for the latest stable version of Spigot are easily accessible online elsewhere. Viewing documentation for older versions typically requires running BuildTools and generating the docs yourself. And of course, the standard Spigot documentation does not offer a dark theme at the time of writing. This webpage aims to make it easier to view various versions of Spigot docs, with a dark restyle.
