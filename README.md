> ## I Need Another Version
If the documentation for the Minecraft version you're looking for isn't listed above, create an Issue on the [Github Repository](https://github.com/Cannicide/dark-spigot-docs/issues). Other than the currently provided versions, versions older than `1.20.3` will not be added unless an Issue is posted specifically requesting it.

> ## Disclaimer
The styling of these docs have been tweaked by Cannicide, but the content of the docs remains the same.

This documentation is being provided online through [spigot.cannicide.net](https://spigot.cannicide.net) as a convenience. Spigot only directly provides online documentation for its latest version. Viewing documentation for older versions typically requires generating the docs yourself. And of course, the standard Spigot documentation does not offer a dark theme at the time of writing.

Cannicide is not affiliated with Spigot, Bukkit, or any other parties involved in the creation of this documentation.
